SOIL AND WATER POLLUTION.


There is no subject of greater interest to the people than that of
health and the best means of obtaining it. Plenty of wholesome food,
good air and pure water constitute the first essentials of right
living. Any thing which contaminates these prime requisites admits a
factor into the problem of life which seriously vitiates its result.
To what extent agents of adulteration have injured the human family
by disease and death we do not know, but the usual estimate made by
sanitarians is, that nearly one-half of the existing diseases might be
abolished, provided that individuals and communities should enter upon
correct modes of living. In the United States over one hundred thousand
persons die annually, and probably one hundred and fifty thousand
persons are constantly sick from causes well known to be preventable.
Dr. Draper says the total number of deaths in Massachusetts during five
years, 1869-73, from all causes was 156,289; of that number the deaths
from zymotic or fermentable diseases comprised 26 per cent.; those from
acute pulmonary diseases were 7 per cent.; and those from phthisis,
17 per cent. So that, if we include all these among the “preventable”
diseases, the deaths from these causes represent one-half the actual
mortality. It is estimated that the productive efficiency of the
average life in this country might be increased 30 per cent.; or up to
the normal amount by the proper observance of health laws. The annual
mortality rate should not exceed 15 per 1,000 in cities under good
sanitary management, but the tables of the National Board of Health
show a greater mortality in almost every city of the country. Zymotic
or preventable diseases are increasing in Indianapolis. From these
diseases 443 deaths occurred in the city during the year 1879—over 32
per cent. more than in 1878—and if such a large number died, it is
fair to calculate that twenty times as many persons were more or less
sick from the same causes. Nearly 33 per cent. of the total deaths of
the city last year were due to zymotic diseases. These facts should
awaken the public to thorough search for the causes at work producing
such a high mortality.

I believe, and it shall be my endeavor to prove, that the increase
of zymotic diseases in the city is due in a great measure to causes
easily preventable. Man, it is true, is born to sorrow; but many of
these sorrows are of his own creation, or are due to his neglect
of established principles. Having determined upon a thorough
investigation, we need only to visit the premises, where typhoid
fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and diseases of this class prevail,
to obtain facts enough to solve the problem. Wherever filth abounds,
whether in the air, the ground, or the water, there will be a fruitful
soil for the propagation of fermentative diseases. To be convinced of
the present and past filthy condition of the city, one should take a
walk through any of the alleys at noonday, and inhale the foul odors
arising constantly from sewers, cess-pools, privies and decaying
animal, vegetable, and excrementitious matters thrown out from kitchens
and stables. An examination of the kitchen and back yard of a house is
sufficient to prove one of two things, either that Biddy is “monarch of
all she surveys,” or that the family need a few practical lessons on
sanitary science. The latter are sure to follow in time.

The increase of zymotic diseases in Indianapolis, is due largely to
soil and water pollution. The conditions of the soil affect our health
through the water we drink and the air we breathe. To effluvia from
the soil, may be attributed, as stated by Parkes, paroxysmal fevers,
typhoid fever, yellow fever, bilious remittent fever, cholera and
dysentery. Waring accepts the theory of the dissemination of typhoid
fever by fecal discharges of the sick, but gives as his opinion that
the disease may be developed by exhalations of decomposing matters in
dung-heaps, pig sties, privy vaults, cellars, cess-pools, drains and
sewers, or it may be due to the presence of the poison deep in the
ground, and its escape in an active condition in ground exhalations.
A cold soil, and a misty, chilly condition of the atmosphere are
caused by large amounts of water in the ground; and persons living
on such soil are disposed to catarrhal complaints, rheumatism and
neuralgia. Dampness of the soil produces malaria and consumption, and
their activity varies with the degree of moisture. The lowering of
the ground water in the malarious districts of Indiana, has greatly
mitigated the paroxysmal fevers which were formerly so prevalent, and
the general healthfulness of the state has been increased by drainage.
The sandy soil underlying Indianapolis retains from 33 to 36 per cent.
of water. A strong clay soil will not retain over 27 per cent. of water.

According to Pettenkofer, Ford and others, an excessive amount of
water in the soil is injurious to health by the effects of dampness.
It favors the decomposition of organic matter in the soil, and the
evolution of unhealthy effluvia. The water is liable to become
polluted, especially when it is the source of supply of water in wells
used for drinking purposes. The soil is so damp in Indianapolis, that
houses built close to the ground are known to be very unhealthy. At
least four-fifths of all the houses in the city are too near the
ground, to insure perfect immunity from dampness, and its blasting
influences to health.

In the construction of dwellings, care should be taken to provide
the most efficient means for excluding dampness from the foundation
walls and basement floors; and the soil should be rendered drier by
underground drainage. Fox says, it is very unwise to allow the soil
close to houses to be defiled by filth; for the fires of a house
creating a force of suction, draw into the house the air contained in
the surrounding soil, as well as of that on which it is built. The
popular impression, that the atmosphere ends where the ground begins,
is a very widely spread delusion. Most soils are more or less porous.
A house built on gravelly soil stands on a foundation composed of a
mixture of two parts of small stones and one part of air. The air may
give place to any gas or to water. Zymotic diseases have been known to
arise from the emanations of soil polluted by excreta, and impurities
from sewers and drains and all other filth. Poisoning by breathing the
gases generated in sewers and cess-pools is not uncommon. In reference
to this point, Dr. Jno. Simon says: “The ferments so far as we know
them, show no power of active diffusion in dry air; but as moisture is
their normal medium, currents of humid air (as from sewers and drains)
can lift them in their full effectiveness, and if into houses or
confined exterior spaces, then with their chief chances of remaining
effective; and ill-ventilated, low-lying localities, if unclean as
regards the removal of their refuse, may especially be expected to have
these ferments present in their common atmosphere as well as of course
teeming in their soil and ground water.”

Indianapolis is in the bottom of a basin, the rim of which rises sixty
or seventy feet all round it, east of White river; in some places as at
Crown Hill to three times that height.

[Illustration]

Let us now inquire into the condition of the soil of the city. We
find that the general direction of the water trend is from northeast
to southwest; that the water level in the wells near the Atlas works
is thirty-five feet above the river level at the city water works;
and that the waterfall is from fifteen to eighteen feet per mile. The
formation of the ground beneath the city is attributed by geologists
to the glacial drift of pre-historic times. From seventy to ninety
feet below the surface the earth is built up of alternate beds of sand
gravel, and clay, and go to show that at some remote period running
water with its leveling and transforming power, aided by the corroding
force of the air, contributed largely to the geological formation which
we find to-day.

After obtaining the distances through these various strata in the
different parts of the city, an average is calculated in the following
order:

Loam, three to four feet; sand and gravel, thirty to forty feet; blue
compact clay (hard-pan), twelve to eighteen feet; sand and gravel, five
to ten feet; soft clay, one to five feet; and blue gravel and boulders
to Devonian limestone, thirty-five to fifty feet. The first stratum of
clay is very hard and tough, and for that reason is called “hard-pan.”
It has an inclination from the northeast to the southwest of about
thirty feet to the mile. The further north and east of White river,
the less distance it is to bed rock. Occasionally below the “hard-pan”
is found a small drift of soft clay, but this is not usual and does
not extend very far in area; often in moving ten feet it is missed.
The first seam of water is usually reached at a depth of seventeen to
twenty-five feet; the second seam at fifty to sixty-five feet; and the
third seam at seventy to ninety feet.

These various strata of water are all what is called “hard water.”
Prof. E. T. Cox states that “the first seam contains the largest amount
of mineral water, principally calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate,
chlorides and ferrous sulphate. The amount of chlorine is so large,
that its presence is due in a great measure to sewage contaminations.
The second seam of water contains but little chlorides, but has about
the same amount of calcic and magnesic carbonates as the first. It is a
good potable water when properly protected from contaminations from the
upper seam. The third seam of water is also a hard water, that is, its
salts will decompose a portion of soap and form a curd; but it contains
less carbonates and more sulphates of the alkaline earths, lime and
magnesia.” Inasmuch as the object of this paper, is to show to what
extent the soil and water of Indianapolis are affected by pollution and
the influence such pollution has on health, it is proper to state as
nearly as possible, the sources from which the contamination arises. By
the assistance of the former civil engineer of the city, the following
estimate was made:

Area of Indianapolis (not including ground unimproved) 5,000 acres.

Within the city limits there are:

    Surface dug wells            15,000
    Driven wells                  5,000
    Open privy vaults            22,000
    Privy vaults filled up       13,000
    Cess-pools                   10,000
    Cess-pools filled up          5,000

The builders of the city state, that in the business portion of the
city, it is not uncommon to discover from three to a half dozen old
privy vaults, in making a single excavation for an ordinary building.

According to the above estimate which is considered very low, 50,000
privy vaults and cess-pools are constantly filling the soil with deadly
poisons, and polluting the water of at least 15,000 surface dug wells,
which furnish drinking water to 50,000 people.

Not more than 6,000 persons drink water from the city water works, and
about 20,000 persons use water from driven wells and cisterns. It is
a rule well established by eastern boards of health, that a dug well
drains a circular area with a radius equal to twice the distance of the
depth of the well. It has been ascertained, that a very large number of
the wells of the city are situated within an average distance of less
than thirty feet of cess-pools and privy vaults, while a great many are
distant from them not over ten feet. Most wells are dug simply with
the view of obtaining water and of having it as convenient to hand as
possible; the cess-pools are dug similarly, with a view to convenience
except that the demand here is that the liquid contents shall readily
drain away. Provided the well furnishes an abundance of water, and the
cess-pool allows the liquid refuse to soak away, and on this account,
seldom requires cleaning out, there is little concern as to what goes
on unobserved beneath the surface of the ground. In the course of time
the well water is discovered to be impure, after sickness, and perhaps
death, have followed its use.

Wells situated on street corners in close proximity to the catch basin
of the sewers, are extremely liable to pollution from leakage from the
foul gutters and seepage from the catch basins.

A notable outbreak of typhoid fever occurred in Louisville, in the
autumn of 1875, from the use of wellwater contaminated by a privy in an
adjoining school yard. The water was found to be impure, and the well
was condemned. “In the summer of 1878 some forty persons in Rochester
whose supply of drinking water was derived from a certain well, were
taken sick with typhoid fever and other zymotic diseases.” The health
officers closed the well and the people got water from other sources.
They began to recover immediately.

“All authorities agree that any well situated within a few feet of a
cess-pool or sewer should be regarded with grave suspicion, for the
intervening soil may become overdone with filth at any moment, and
cease to act as an efficient filter of the polluted water, and allow
organic matter to enter the well; or animal filth may be washed into
the well at any time by a hard rain.”

A great many citizens of Indianapolis are drinking water exclusively
from cisterns. It is difficult to estimate the number of cisterns
within the city limits; but a great deal may be said in regard to the
general unwholesomeness of the water they contain. Rain water contains
a small proportion of chlorine, the amount varying with the condition
of the atmosphere, and the purity of the shedding surface.

When pure rain falls upon a roof it carries down with it all the
impurities accumulated there during dry weather; these soon putrify in
the cistern, and infect the water.

The majority of the cisterns in the city are faulty in some
particular—either proper care was not exercised in their construction,
or the necessary repairs were not made in due time—and they are
found to be seeping, or leaky. Sufficient attention is not given to
keeping the cisterns well closed, and the result is that filth in large
quantities is to be found on emptying them. During my examinations I
have met with many cistern waters in the city so polluted by sewage
infiltration, that an immediate interdict on their use appeared to be
called for. Owing to the impurity of the soil, sewage matter finds its
way into hundreds of cisterns, and contaminates the water. Many of our
cisterns contain water rank with vegetable or animal impurity, and the
contents of the greater portion of these are not above suspicion. Some
of them are neither more or less than shallow wells, receiving more of
their contents by percolation than by inflow above.

Last December 458 cisterns in Memphis, Tenn., were examined with the
following result: Sound, 209; seeping, eighty-two; and undoubtedly
leaking, 167. In the total number, there were 249 condemned as unfit
for use. To what extent these leaky cisterns contributed to the
epidemic of yellow fever we cannot tell. The probability of sewage
contamination in each instance was strong.

In the year of 1879 there were seventy-eight deaths from typhoid and
typho-malarial fevers in Indianapolis. It may be stated as a probable
fact, that our siege of fevers in 1879 originated and was afterward
propagated in polluted drinking water, and ill-ventilated apartments
poisoned by sewer gases, or in close proximity to foul and overflowing
water closets and cess-pools. Forty-three per cent. of the total deaths
in the city in 1879 were deaths of children under five years of age.
Among the general causes of the high death rate of infants, may be
mentioned poverty and ignorance. These two conditions existing in the
parents, are great enemies of the public health and are two important
factors which go to make up this startling infantile mortality. But
it must be conceded that typhoid fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria,
measles, hooping cough and diarrhœal diseases have been endemic in our
midst as the result of foul air and polluted water. Deaths from these
causes occur more or less at all ages, but distinctively more among
children. The influence of filth causes the infants and young children
to die at twice, or thrice, or four times their fair standard rate of
mortality; and this disproportion seems to mark the young lives as
finer tests of soil and water pollution than are the acclimated adults.
The board of health of Indianapolis report that hundreds of cellars
in this city are full, or partly full of water, the entire year; and
that the increase of zymotic diseases is due largely to wet and damp
cellars, as well as to the long continued and general practice of
covering up foul privy vaults, after they have become full, to save the
expense of removing the contents.

Being thoroughly impressed with the facts above enumerated, I commenced
to make investigations. I employed a competent chemist, Mr. Jno. Hurty,
to make sanitary examinations of water, and assist me in the work.

In the collection of samples of water, special care was exercised
in regard to cleanliness and to avoid introducing any errors into
our examinations. Below I give a tabular statement of the analyses
of waters taken from surface dug wells in the city. Excepting the
permanganate of potash test, the quantities are in one litre (22-100ths
of an imperial gallon).

                                      NOTE: ???? means not obtained.

In regard to the wholesomeness or unwholesomeness of water, Watt’s
Dictionary of Chemistry gives the following: “Water suitable for
economical, technical or culinary purposes should not contain of solid
constituents to exceed five-tenths of a gramme to one gramme per litre.
Water containing one-tenth gramme per litre of organic matter is unfit
for culinary purposes or drinking. Wholesome water should not contain
of organic matter more than five-one thousanth to one one-hundredth
gramme per liter. As a rule, water containing as much as one
one-hundredth of a gramme of chlorine per litre may be suspected of
being contaminated with drainage. Whenever in water the oxygen amounts
to less than one-third of the nitrogen, and the water also causes a
considerable reduction of permanganate of potash, the presence of
decomposing organic substance is probable. The capability of water to
remain for some days at a temperature of about 22°C, without undergoing
decomposition is of great importance in reference to the question of
wholesomeness.”

The permanganate of potash test given above was as follows: The test
solution was distilled water, one litre, and permanganate of potash,
one gramme. Of this solution, the number of drops required to render
fifty cubic centimetres of the water under examination permanently
red, were reported. It should be understood that the same quantity of
distilled water required but eight drops of the test solution to become
permanently red.

The first sample of water was taken from a well where fourteen persons
were simultaneously attacked in December last by typho-malarial and
diarrhœal diseases. All had been drinking water from this well, and
had it not been for the timely help of the physician who condemned the
water.


SERIOUS RESULTS WOULD HAVE FOLLOWED.

On examination the cess-pool was found to be connected directly with
the well by a pipe, and when the cess-pool became full, its contents
regurgitated into the well. The Board of Health examined the premises,
condemned the well and ordered that both privy vault and cess-pool be
cleaned out without delay. I understand that it is quite common in this
city to connect the cess-pool with the well by a pipe so that the waste
water may be readily conveyed away; but if people knew the danger to
be feared from such an arrangement, greater care in the construction
of drains would be exercised. Hundreds of cases might be related where
in houses fitted with all that taste could desire, and gold procure, a
siphoned trap, or in the absence of a trap, an imperfect joint, or an
old brick drain, or riddled soil pipe, defects easily remedied if known
to exist, have undermined the health of adults and slain the little
ones. In the first sample a large quantity of animalculæ were revealed
by the microscope. Fox states that “the existence of animal life in a
water affords good evidence in itself of the presence of a very
sensible amount of organic matter, _alias_ filth. These little
creatures feed and flourish on what we call organic matter, and in
perfectly pure water they cannot live. A perfectly pure water contains
no suspended matter nor any animal or vegetable life. The ova of the
round and the thread worms, the eggs and joints of the tapeworm and
small leeches, which may give rise to grave disorders, should not be
forgotten in making microscopic examinations of drinking waters.”

Good water is both a necessity and a priceless blessing. Foul water
is a scourge and a messenger of death. No one except a brute would
hesitate which to choose if he could tell one from the other. It is
only with the grosser pollution of water that chemists can apply their
science. Infinitesimal pollution cannot be estimated by the skill of
any chemist. It is the careful physician who decides more accurately
in regard to the purity of water than the chemist. Sir Benj. Brodie in
speaking of the detection of infinitesimal pollution says: “I think
you have a much better chance of getting at these relations through
accurate medical statistics, properly applied, than you have through
chemical analysis, because chemical analysis is one of the poorest
things possible to reach those delicate quantities. You cannot get at
these small quantities at all; chemical analysis must be limited by our
power of weighing and measuring. It may go on to a certain point, but
we cannot go beyond that point.”

The well from which the second sample was taken, was within twenty-five
feet of a privy vault twenty feet deep. Several families used water
from the well. Two cases of

TYPHOID FEVER DEVELOPED

in one family, and all the persons who drank the water were constantly
ailing. The third sample was taken from a well where four cases of
typhoid fever had occurred. A thorough search had been made for the
cause of the trouble. The well water had been suspected and was
condemned by the attending physician.

Seventy feet from the wall there was a privy vault overflowing. Another
vault was within twenty-five feet of the well. To the effluvia from
the former was attributed one case of typhoid fever. The stench was so
great at night that not even the windows in the upper stories of the
houses in the neighborhood could be kept open. People living near had
sore throats, malarial fever and diarrhœal disorders.

The fourth sample was obtained from a surface dug well, from which the
inmates of the State Female Reformatory were supplied with drinking
water. Since the first of last August thirty-nine cases of well defined
typhoid fever, and thirteen milder cases of the same disease appeared
in the Reformatory. The attending physician attributed the outbreak
of the fever to the water from the well. After a thorough chemical
examination of the water, the well was condemned and filled up, and the
water supply now comes from a driven well.

It is worthy of remark that the persons attacked by typhoid fever, had
been daily drinking the foul water from the well until the appearance
of the fever; that the immediate surroundings of the well and the
sanitary condition of the building were good, and that no direct cause
of typhoid fever outside of the well could be discovered.

The fifth sample was taken from a well which supplied a family of six
persons with water. Diarrhœal troubles,

SYMPTOMS OF TYPHOID FEVER,

sore throats, etc., were not uncommon, and the family physician was
frequently consulted. One privy vault forty feet north from the well
was full. Another privy vault was fifty feet northeast of the well. The
contents of the vaults undoubtedly contaminated the well water to some
extent, and of course the evil would be increased with time.

The sixth sample was drawn from a well on the south side of the city.
No privy vault or cess-pool is located within fifty feet of it. To all
appearances the surroundings are good. The well water has been used
for drinking purposes for several years. One person in the family had
typhoid fever three years ago, and malarial and bilious attacks have
annoyed the other members of the family frequently.

The seventh sample was obtained from a well from which three cases
of typhoid fever had previously been supplied with water. The
attending physician attributed the development of the disease to the
unwholesomeness of the water.

The eighth sample was obtained from one of the wells at the water works.

The following table gives the analyses of waters from driven wells
extended below the first or second stratum of clay. These wells are
located in different parts of the city. Excepting the permanganate of
potash test, previously explained, the quantities are in one litre.

I have in my possession partial and complete analyses by Prof. E. T.
Cox, of waters from nine other driven wells in the city. The analyses
show that these wells furnish good potable water.

The occupants of large buildings are often supplied with water from
tanks on the upper floors. If the tanks are not properly constructed
and well inclosed, the water pumped into them may be contaminated at
any time by impurities.

Given below are analyses of waters drawn from tanks in large blocks.

The quantities are in one litre.

One person who lived in the former block died of typhoid fever, and
many others had sickness from the use of the water.

The question of drainage and water supply of cities, should take the
precedence of every other question, for upon its proper solution
depends thousands of lives. Those in authority should understand its
importance, and feel the pressing necessity of more thorough sanitary
work. Hygiene is not only a subject of scientific interest to the
medical man, but its problems and discoveries ought to be of great
practical importance to political economists and legislators, who
usually occupy themselves with subjects which benefit the common people
very little. It appears that the best engineering talent, and great
amounts of money, have been employed, to furnish cities and towns with
_inexhaustible supplies of water without sufficient regard to quality_.

To economically furnish water in ample quantity, is an object of great
importance; but it is of more consequence that the water obtained is
not contaminated by sewers, cess-pools, and surface drainage to such an
extent that disease and death shall be scattered broadcast; among those
who drink the water. There are those who claim that a small proportion
of sewage in drinking water does not necessarily prove deleterious to
health.

The English Rivers’ Pollution Commission published conclusions based
on the examination of some two thousand samples of water claimed to be
drinkable; condemning river water because it is liable to contamination
from drainage of cultivated land, towns and manufactories. According to
their decision “the admixture of even a small quantity of the infected
discharges (of persons suffering from cholera or typhoid fever), with
a large volume of drinking water, is sufficient for the propagation of
those diseases among persons using such water.”

Dr. Folsom, in the report of the Massachusetts State Board of Health,
states that “excessive dilution simply diminishes the chances of danger
from any particular tumblerful.” To show how disease may be transmitted
in dilute sewage and that disease germs are not exterminated by
diffusion through a large body of running water, Dr. E. D. Mapother, of
Dublin, reports forty cases of typhoid fever occurring in a hospital
which received its supply from a river. The cause was traced to some
barracks twenty-five miles higher up, from which typhoidal dejections
had been emptied through drains into the river.

The following classification of drinkable waters which was made by
the English commissioners, should be received by us as entirely
trustworthy.

        _Wholesome_—Spring water, deep well water, and
           upland surface water.

        _Suspicious_—Stored rain water, and surface water
           from cultivated land.

        _Dangerous_—River water to which sewage gets
           access, and shallow well water.

The fact that foul water will breed disease, should no longer be
ignored. The citizens of Indianapolis have been drinking water from the
city water works not above suspicion, and it is about time that the
pollution of the water by filth should excite public attention.

Below I give analyses of samples of water drawn at different times and
places from the faucets of the city water works.

The following report is from Prof. Thos. C. Van Nuys, of the State
University.

                       BLOOMINGTON, Ind., May 10, 1880.

The water you sent on Thursday was received on Friday evening. The
following is the report of my chemical and microscopic examinations:

In one litre (1,000 cubic centimetres).

    Nitric acid anhydride, N₂O₅.    10.72   milligrammes
    Ammonia, NH₃,                    0.03        ”
    Carbonic acid anhydride, CO₂.    0.439    gramme.
    Calcium oxide, CaO,              0.148      ”
    Magnesium oxide, MgO,            0.04128    ”
    Chlorine,                        0.09218    ”
    Degree of hardness (English)    25.7

The organic matter in 100 cubic centimetres of the water required
3.11 cubic centimetres of the 1-100 normal solution of potassium
permanganate to oxidize it; therefore one litre of the water would
require 31.1 cubic centimetres of the 1-100 normal solution KMnO₄
to oxidize the organic matter. In 31.1 c. c. of this solution there
is 0.0098 gramme KMnO₄ or 0.0247 gramme oxygen liberated. I would
remark here that there is no method of estimating the exact quantity
of organic matter in water. The method of estimating the carbon and
hydrogen by combustion analysis (Frankland and Armstrong’s) has been
found defective,—also the methods based on the estimation of nitrogen
and reduction of silver oxide. The method employed in this case
(Schultze’s) is the most reliable, and yet not all the organic matter
is oxidized, for some is volatized in boiling.

I found the following infusorial animalaculcæ: Stylonchia pustulata,
actinurus neptunius, rotirfer vulgaris, monostylaquadridentata,
navicular baltica.

I give here the magnified pictures.

[Illustration: Actinurus Neptunius.]

[Illustration: Navicula Baltica.]

[Illustration: Monosty la Quadridentata.]

[Illustration: Rotifer Vulgaris.]

[Illustration: Stylonchia Pustulata.]

I did not examine the first sample of water with the microscope. In
the water of the second bottle I found but one kind of infusoria,
_viz._, stylonchia pustulata, but they were numerous. In the water
sent on Thursday I found the others named, but few in number. In both
samples of water there was but a small quantity of mineral matter, a
few crystals of CaCO₃. The water was somewhat cloudy and the suspended
particles were evidently of vegetable origin. I have not adopted any
standard in judging water for drinking purposes.

As yet none has been found having a scientific basis. But let us see
how this water would be rated by some of the standards of men who have
justly distinguished themselves by their labor in water analysis. The
Grenzzahlen limitary numbers are of E. Reichardt, Kubel, and Tiemann
and Fischer.

One litre (1,000 cubic centimetres).

    ===================================================================

This water contains in milligrammes per litre: Nitric Acid Anhyd.
10.72; Chlorine, 92.18; Lime, 14.8; Magnesia, 41; degrees of hardness
(German), 20.596.

The limitary quantity of organic matter in 100 c. c. should not exceed
that necessary for the deoxidation of K Mn 04 in 2 c. c. of the 1-100
normal solution. This is given by Fresenius. For 100 c. c. of this
water 3.11 c. c. of the 1-100 normal solution was required. The organic
matter in the water is considerable, yet is no doubt variable in
quantity. On account of the quantity of the organic matter, by exposure
to the air doubtless many other species of infusoria would be formed.
The water is hard and by chemical technologists would be condemned, as
with them 10 degrees German, or 12.5 degrees English, is the limit.

The ammonia is in a mere trace, yet accurately estimated as given.
Nearly all rain water contains more. I have estimated the chlorine
in water sent on Thursday last (by the volumetric method), and found
0.05992 gramme chlorine in one litre. This makes a difference of 0.0322
gramme chlorine as found in one litre of the water of the first bottle
sent. In what way could there be such a great increase or rather
decrease of the chlorides? Are there any privy vaults or slaughter
houses near the source of the water? May I ask where this water was
obtained?

In a letter of March 12, 1880, Prof. E. T. Cox gives the following: “I
fully believe that whenever any form of disease rages as an epidemic
in any locality, it is due in a large measure to water pollution. The
three streams of subterranean water beneath Indianapolis, flow from
northeast to southwest. Wells that are supplied from the upper water,
contain more and more chloride of sodium (common salt) as you go to the
south part of the city, and this is absolute proof of sewer-pollution,
and all the well water from the first and second seams is absolutely
dangerous, and its use should be prohibited. The lower stratum is safe
if the upper seams are shut off from it. When water works were first
contemplated at Indianapolis, I was called upon for information, and
had my advise been taken, you would now have the best possible water,
instead of water of doubtful character, to use the mildest term.” On
the 20th of March a sample of water was obtained from the water works
for examination. The analysis showed in one litre,

    Total solids,             .985  gramme
    Organic and volatile,     .08     ”
    Chlorine,                 .055    ”

Fifty centimetres of the water required fourteen drops of the
permanganate of potash solution to render it permanently red. The same
amount of distilled water required but eight drops. The microscope,
with a lens of 100 diameters, revealed considerable vegetable matter.

Inasmuch as White river is used by the water works as a source of
supply when the water in their wells get low, and also in time of fire
in the city, it was thought advisable to ascertain the condition of the
river water. Therefore, on April 30, 1880, a sample was drawn from the
river at middle of the iron bridge at the foot of Washington street.

One litre contained:

    Total solid constituents         .36     gramme.
    Organic and volatile matter      .032      ”
    Chlorine                         .105      ”
    Free ammonia                     .00072    ”
    Albuminoid ammonia               .00048    ”

Fifty cubic centimetres of this water required thirty-six drops of the
permanganate of potash solution to render it permanently red. The same
amount of distilled water required but eight drops of said solution to
become permanently red.

The microscope revealed sand, clay, legs, and other parts of insects,
foreign matter of many kinds, and animalculæ. This water is but little
better than sewage. It is due to the water works to state that the
water taken from the river is filtered through a bed of sand and gravel
about four feet deep.

Professor Edward R. Taylor, of Cleveland, examined two samples of water
from the water works with the following result:

                                             1st sample.  2d sample.
    Specific gravity                            10019       10021
      In grams per litre the analyses show
    Solid residue                               .5876       .5696
    Organic and Volatile matter                 .3150       .1213
    Chlorine                                    .0598       .0738
    Free ammonia                                .0015       .0002
    Albuminoid ammonia                          .0038       .0018

The amount of chlorine is very considerable in both samples. It would
properly be presumed that both had a bad origin.

The following is taken from _The State Press_, Iowa City, Iowa, April
14, 1880:

“The Des Moines City Council spent several days inspecting the various
systems of water works through Iowa, Illinois and Indiana and came back
discouraged and disgusted with what they had seen.” The _Leader_ says:
“The last report made was from Indianapolis, where the water was bad,
the contract bad, and all the conditions were very bad. But for that
matter those things are getting monotonous. On the whole route, from
Burlington to Peoria, water was not found fit to drink, and in several
places it was too bad to wash in. At Springfield water is taken out of
the Illinois river, thick and black, and pumped about the city without
even an excuse made toward filtering it, and yet the money spent on
her water works aggregates nearly three times the hundred thousand
of dollars the works in Des Moines are offered at. The State Board
of Health has declared the water unfit for use. At Indianapolis the
Secretary of the Water Company said they could not recommend the water;
at Burlington, with her new and cheap works, the filter is reported
broken and the yellow Mississippi mud is daily dished up for men to
wash their eyes in. There was no excuse made for the mixture of mud and
water at Keokuk, it is probably past the day of excuses.”

On May 18, 1880, a sample of water was drawn from a faucet of the
Water Works Company. The analysis revealed the following. Each litre
contained:

    Total solids                    .84 gramme.
    Organic and volatile matter     .43    ”
    Chlorine                        .047   ”
    Free ammonia                    .00008 ”
    Albuminoid ammonia              .00024 ”
    Nitrates and nitrites           Large amount.

The value of the above figures can best be understood when it is known
that pure spring water never contains over .000005 gramme of free
ammonia, and .00002 gramme albuminoid ammonia per litre. The best
authorities state that, that water is suspicious which contains above
.0001 gramme of albuminoid ammonia per litre; and over .00015 gramme of
albuminoid ammonia per litre ought to condemn absolutely.

Another sample of water from the water works was sent to Prof. Van
Nuys, on May 27, 1880. He reports that the water contained much more
organic matter than that in which an estimation of organic matter was
made before.

The following statement is from Prof. Van Nuys, July 14, 1880, in
regard to water from the water works. _Chemical and microscopic
examination of water received from Dr. M. T. Runnels, of Indianapolis,
on June 23 and 29, 1880_:

“The organic matter in 100 cubic centimetres of the water required
5.35 cubic centimetres of the one one-hundredth normal potassium
permanganate solution. In 5.35 cubic centimetres of this solution there
are 1.6932 milligrammes potassium permanganate or 0.428 milligrammes
oxygen was liberated, hence in one litre of the water the organic
matter would require 53.5 cubic centimetres of the one one-hundredth
normal permanganate solution, or 4.28 milligrammes oxygen would combine
with the carbon and hydrogen of the organic matter.

    Residue (one litre filtered) heated to 180° centimetres    473.8
    Chlorine                                                   189.3
    Nitric acid anhyd (N₂O₅)                                    17.448
    Nitrous acid anhyd (N₂O₃)                                  a trace
    Ammonia (NH₃)                                                0.38
    Calcium oxide (CaO)                                        128.8
    Magnesium oxide (MgO)                                       46.2
    Degree of hardness, English                                 21.93
       or, degree of hardness, German                           17.54

No microscopic examination was made of the water received June 23d. In
that received June 29th, there were numerous flakes of what appeared
to be organic bodies with granular matter, the following infusorial
animalculæ were found:

[Illustration: Closterium Acerosum.]

[Illustration: Glaucoma scintillans.]

[Illustration: _a_ Monas crepusculum. _b_ Monas punctum.]

The residue, organic matter, chlorine, nitric acid anhyd, and ammonia
were estimated in the water received June 23d. The calcium and
magnesium were estimated in the water received June 29, 1880.”

Although much has lately been said regarding impure water and the
startling mortality of Indianapolis, there are a great many people who
persistently refuse to accept the facts and would rather submit to a
large death rate than to “clean up” or go to the necessary expense
of obtaining good water. The complaint is often made that doctors do
not discharge their duties in warning the people against the dangers
of sickness. The fact is that the medical profession gives enough
wholesome advice to the public, but very few persons make practical use
of the information kindly given.

I commenced last January a series of soil and water investigations. A
partial report of my investigations was published in the Indianapolis
_News_, May 25 and July 13, 1880, and the Indianapolis _Saturday
Herald_, June 5, 1880. Since that time with the assistance of the best
chemists I have zealously prosecuted the work.

It is not an exaggeration to say that no dug well within a mile of
Circle street, can be depended upon for a continuous supply of good
water. The water furnished to the people by the water works company is
no better than the water from the average dug well. Water from deep
driven wells is the best well water we have.

I found the alleys, by-ways, back yards and stables all through the
city in a very filthy condition. Privy vaults have been dug without
being cemented, and no care whatever has been taken to keep them clean.

The drainage of the city is very defective. It is only along a few
of the principal streets that sewers have been constructed, and the
greater portion of the city has no drainage at all. It is a very common
thing to find standing water and large mud holes in every direction
through the city. It is a notable fact that the water level in many
cellars corresponds with the water level of dug wells and privy vaults
adjacent. Is it any wonder that infant mortality is so great in the
city?

If “infants of one year and under drink but little water,” they do
breathe in this city the deadly gases developed by the action of the
hot sun on decaying organic and vegetable matters, and the effluvia
arising constantly from overflowing privy vaults and cess-pools.
Sickness is sure to follow and death may abruptly terminate the young
life. According to the report of the Board of Health the deaths in this
city have been since January 1, 1876, as follows:

    In 1876 the number of deaths were             1,641
    ”  1877  ”    ”    ”    ”     ”               1,528
    ”  1878  ”    ”    ”    ”     ”               1,296
    ”  1879  ”    ”    ”    ”     ”               1,470
    ”  1880  ”    ”    ”    ”     ”   (9 months)  1,352
                                                  ———
            Total                                 7,287

Assuming that the population has been 75,125, the annual death rate
would be:

    21.8 per 1,000 in                 1876
    20.3  ”    ”   ”                  1877
    17.2  ”    ”   ”                  1878
    19.5  ”    ”   ”                  1879
    23.9  ”    ”   ”  (9 months)      1880

The average would be 20.5 per 1,000 annually which is at least six
above what it should be.

Herewith I give a table of recent sanitary analyses of our city well
and cistern waters, which startlingly outline the impending dangers and
serve as texts for many cases of ill health and death already met by
those who have drank the waters.

The first and second samples were taken from two wells in the rear of a
block having about twenty occupants. An inspection of the back yard and
alley showed an immense amount of filth. There was no sewer to carry
away slop or excrementitious matters. A large privy vault was in the
rear of the block. There was one well north and another south of the
vault, and about twenty feet from it. These wells supplied the water
to the occupants of the block. Six cases of scarlet fever were there
developed and three of them died. The other persons in the block were
constantly ailing. One of the leading physicians of the city attributed
the outbreak of the fever to the bad surroundings and the impure water.

The third sample was taken from a well on East Walnut street. The
family using the water were more or less sick all the time. Languor,
loss of appetite and spirits, sleeplessness, or nightmare, morning
diarrhœa, headache and nausea, one or all, continually annoyed those
drinking the water. The privy vault, twelve feet deep was forty feet
northeast of the well.

The fourth sample was obtained from a well on North Tennessee street.
Throat affections, fevers, diarrhœas, headaches with malaise, etc., made
up the list of the complaints of the family using the water.

The fifth sample came from a well on North Alabama street. During the
last three months, among those who drank the water there were three who
had scarlet fever—one of whom died. And so on similar reports can be
made of the other samples, except those marked “good” or “excellent.”

It is very surprising to me that many people are so ignorant in regard
to impure water and its deleterious effect on health. I have met with
“would be” highly educated persons who have regarded, and do regard any
agitation of this subject, as of little value to the public, and as
very damaging to the fair fame of the city, and for that reason to be
at all hazards covered up and kept secret.

They also express the thought that every kind of water is filled with
microscopic creatures, and that a small amount of filth or dirt in
drinking water does no special harm to anyone. All this is the opposite
of the facts. Prof. Barnard, of Cornell University, says: “Pure water
is not inhabited by organisms; on the contrary stagnant water or impure
water alone affords them subsistence. They hasten the destruction of
dead animal and vegetable matters the waters may contain, causing for
the time being an infusion or fermentation.”

Macdonald states that “mineral particles may affect health on account
of their mechanical action, as for example when mineral silt or clay
causes diarrhœa. Dead animal and vegetable substances may have more
important effects, as when suspended fecal matter produces irritation
of the whole alimentary tract. On the other hand, living things, such
as the ova of entozoa, the nematoid worms and small leeches may give
rise at once to certain grave disorders, or algæ may act on sulphates
and disengage sulphuretted hydrogen.”

Pure water is one of God’s best gifts to man, and if that is allowed to
be adulterated the impairment of our health and the destruction of our
happiness is sure to follow.

In the samples of dug well waters which have recently been analyzed,
the following animalculæ in addition to those given above were found by
the use of the different powers of the microscope:

At Indianapolis we have on the Board of Health three earnest and
capable physicians who thoroughly understand the present necessities
and stand ready to enforce all laws pertaining to public health; but
our laws on hygiene are very inefficient, and the power and usefulness
of the board are unwisely limited; therefore the board can do little
towards averting the calamity already upon us. The Board of Health need
more money, more men and the largest liberty of action.

We shall never have a healthy city until the health department is
advanced to the position it deserves. We need a vigorous public
sentiment in favor of cleanliness and hygienic measures. The best
thought and energies of physicians and scientists everywhere should be
directed to questions pertaining to water supply, sewerage and garbage
of cities, and if necessary to secure proper legislation, the people
must arise in their might and compel timid and shortsighted rulers to
give better laws on sanitary matters and more money to make the laws
effective.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
